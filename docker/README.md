# Docker Notes

These notes cover important topics related to Docker that I have identified. I have included examples and explanations to help me better understand these concepts and fill any gaps in my knowledge. These notes will serve as a valuable resource for me to review.

# Example 
`docker run -p 38282:8080 -d kodekloud/simple-webapp:blue`
