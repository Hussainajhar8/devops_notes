# Kubernetes Notes

These notes cover important topics related to Kubernetes that I have identified while preparing for the Certified Kubernetes Administrator certification exam. I have included examples and explanations to help me better understand these concepts and fill any gaps in my knowledge. These notes will serve as a valuable resource for me to review and revise before the exam.
